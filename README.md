# The Ultimate Python - Fibonacci
[The Ultimate Python](https://www.youtube.com/@pycoddiy) is a new YouTube channel from @PyCodDIY covering different aspects of performance programming with Python.

This repo provides sources for videos aiming to illustrate the performance programming with Python by taking a problem of computing of the Fibonacci sequence for large numbers. 

The repository contains two Python scripts
1. `fibonacci.py` - Variety of implementations to evaluate their performance efficiency
2. `fib_visual.py` - Visual representation of the Fibonacci numbers as a spiral of growing squares

## Prerequisites

Before running `fibonacci.py` please make sure your Python environment has `numpy`. 
To install `numpy` in your current environment use the following command:

`conda install numpy`

Before running `fib_visual.py` please make sure your Python environment has `matplotlib`. 
To install `matplotlib` in your current environment use the following command:

`conda install matplotlib`
